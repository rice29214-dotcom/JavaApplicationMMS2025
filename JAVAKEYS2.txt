Java Keywords and Short Notes
abstract – Used to declare abstract classes and methods (no implementation).

assert – Tests assumptions in code during debugging.

boolean – Declares a true/false variable.

break – Exits loop or switch immediately.

byte – 8-bit integer data type.

case – Defines a branch in a switch statement.

catch – Handles exceptions in try-catch block.

char – Stores a single character.

class – Declares a class.

const – Reserved but not used.

continue – Skips to next loop iteration.

default – Default case in switch or default method in interface.

do – Starts a do-while loop.

double – 64-bit floating point number.

else – Alternative block for if statement.

enum – Declares a fixed set of constants.

extends – Inherits a class.

final – Constant variable / method cannot be overridden / class cannot be inherited.

finally – Block that always runs after try-catch.

float – 32-bit floating point number.

for – Loop with initialization, condition, increment.

goto – Reserved but not used.

if – Conditional statement.

implements – Class implements an interface.

import – Imports packages/classes.

instanceof – Checks object type.

int – 32-bit integer.

interface – Blueprint of a class.

long – 64-bit integer.

native – Method implemented in other languages (C/C++).

new – Creates new objects.

package – Declares package name.

private – Accessible only within class.

protected – Accessible within package and subclasses.

public – Accessible everywhere.

return – Returns value from method.

short – 16-bit integer.

static – Belongs to class, not object.

strictfp – Ensures consistent floating-point calculations.

super – Refers to parent class object.

switch – Multi-branch decision statement.

synchronized – Controls thread access to code.

this – Refers to current object.

throw – Explicitly throws an exception.

throws – Declares possible exceptions.

transient – Prevents variable serialization.

try – Defines block for exception handling.

void – Method returns no value.

volatile – Variable may be changed by multiple threads.

while – Loop while condition is true.

Extra newer Java keywords (modules & var)
var – Local variable type inference (Java 10).

record – Declares compact data class (Java 16).

sealed – Restricts class inheritance (Java 17).

permits – Lists allowed subclasses of sealed class.

non-sealed – Allows subclass of sealed class to be open.

module – Defines a module (Java 9).

requires – Declares module dependency.
